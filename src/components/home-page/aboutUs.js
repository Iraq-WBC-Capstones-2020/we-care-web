                About Us
              </div>
              <p className=" text-base text-white">
                We believe that what we really need sometimes is for someone to
                be there and listen while we try to make some sense of our
                thoughts. Someone who is patient and understating enough to not
                judge the messy, or lost us, we sometimes can be. We believe
                that imperfections are what makes us human and we all, with our
                different points of view, can help each other grow in sometimes
                surprising ways.
